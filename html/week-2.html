            <ul>
            <li>I’m continuing my exploration of <a
            href="https://docs.dagger.io/ci/quickstart/daggerize">Dagger</a>,
            attempting to replicate a complex GitHub workflow we use at
            work. My goal is to understand how much the container
            overhead affects total execution time. This tool could also
            solve another significant pain point in my company’s
            workflow (which I believe is common beyond just my use
            case): the ability to run a pipeline anywhere, even on my
            local machine. You might think your existing pipeline works
            well enough and there’s no reason to refactor everything
            you’ve built over the years for a shiny new tool—I
            completely agree with that assessment. However, we also know
            that eventually pipelines accumulate so much logic (spread
            across different places and languages) that they become
            proper software requiring maintenance. Since testing can be
            challenging, why not use a tool that leverages your
            programming language of choice and Docker to manage your
            workflows?</li>
            <li>This week I attended <a href="https://osday.dev/">Source
            Day 2025</a> in Florence for the second consecutive year.
            Although the format changed from last year and the talks
            aligned less with my interests, both the atmosphere and
            location were excellent. These events provide opportunities
            to meet incredible people with shared interests, and
            conversing with them is always a pleasure. Working in a
            remote-first company, every opportunity to meet teammates in
            person is valuable—this was definitely the highlight of my
            trip. I returned home energized and motivated to contribute
            more to open source projects.</li>
            <li>This week I swapped my 7-year-old Pixelbook for another
            Chromebook I own, as the old one had become very sluggish. I
            took some time to study how ChromeOS, Termina, and Crostini
            work, and decided to try installing NixOS on Crostini with
            decent results. I’ll write a detailed guide in the coming
            days. My journey to <em>put NixOS everywhere</em>
            continues…</li>
