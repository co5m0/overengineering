            <strong>TL;DR</strong>: After wanting to start a blog for
            ages, I finally decided to commit to weekly writing to help
            complete my side projects. After exploring options, I
            discovered Cloudflare’s hosting capabilities and settled on
            using Markdown with <a
            href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html">pandoc</a> as the
            ideal solution for my needs.
            </summary>
            <p>I’ve always wanted to start a personal blog, but I never
            had the courage to build one or try popular platforms like
            Medium or Substack. A few days ago while exercising at the
            gym, I had a realization: setting a weekly deadline to write
            about my recent activities would motivate me to accomplish
            more and potentially finish my side projects instead of
            abandoning them on GitHub. Perhaps I’ll finally open-source
            some of them. I grabbed my phone and began researching
            popular options. My requirements were straightforward:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Custom domain support</li>
            <li>Simple writing and publishing process</li>
            <li>Clean, minimal design and features</li>
            <li>RSS feed functionality</li>
            <li>Good code display capabilities</li>
            <li>Free and preferably not corporate-owned</li>
            </ul>
            The last requirement eliminated most blogging platforms
            (despite Substack’s interesting approach). I then realized I
            would need to host something myself, so I checked
            Cloudflare, my domain provider, for included hosting
            options. I discovered they support numerous web frameworks
            and offer automatic building and deployment from Git
            repositories. Among the frameworks listed, Hugo caught my
            eye, so I dove into the documentation. Unfortunately,
            everything seemed overly complex for my simple needs. I
            considered writing plain HTML files (which Cloudflare’s CDN
            supports), but creating raw HTML is just as tedious as
            learning a new tool like Hugo. I concluded that Markdown
            might be the ideal solution to focus on writing without HTML
            complexities. After exploring various tools, I discovered <a
            href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html">pandoc</a>, which
            claims to be the leading converter between markup formats.
